# 🎯 Project Objective

To develop a full-featured Service Desk Application that enables users to register, log in, and create/manage support tickets with a seamless and responsive user experience. Built using a MERN-inspired stack, the application emphasizes secure authentication (JWT), effective ticket workflows, and an intuitive interface for efficient issue tracking and resolution. The solution streamlines internal or customer-facing support processes.
